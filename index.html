<!--lang attribute helps in the page to get indexed in search results and also for screen readers
    as a word can be pronounced different in differnt languages. example lang="en-US"
    For example, if a user searches for content in a specific language, search engines can use the 
    lang attribute to identify web pages that match their language preferences and present those pages 
    higher in the search results. This can help improve the visibility and accessibility of a website 
    or web application for users who speak different languages.

    <!-- In mobile or narrow devices, browsers normally render the page in a virutual screen or viewport, which is usually larger
         than the device width. The page is then zoomed out to device size to show the entire page. This is done by the browser to 
         make the page optimized for mobile view, if not for the zooming out, there will be scrollbars.

         But when the page is optimized for mobile-view using media-queries, the queries don't work properly becase they are based on
         viewport size which is larger than the device width. In-order to avoid this issue we need to include the meta viewport tag
         to specify the mobile browser that the viewport width should be equal to the device-width.

    <!-- canonical-url and alternate urls -->
    <link rel="canonical" href="" />
    <!-- The rel="canonical" attribute is used to tell search engines which URL represents the preferred version of a web page
    when there are multiple versions of the same content. For example, if a blog post appears on multiple pages of a website
    (such as on the main blog page and on a category page), the rel="canonical" tag can be used to tell search engines which
    URL should be indexed and displayed in search results.    
    In the example you provided, the canonical URL is set to https://www.setmore.com/, indicating that this is the preferred
    version of the web page and that other versions (such as non-www versions or versions with tracking parameters) should
    be considered duplicate content. -->
    <link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="" />
    <!-- The rel="alternate" attribute is used to indicate that there are alternate versions of a web page available, such as in
    different languages or for different regions. The hreflang attribute is used to specify the language or region of each
    alternate URL.    
    In the example you provided, the hreflang attribute is set to "x-default", which indicates that the specified URL
    (https://www.setmore.com/) should be used as the default version of the page for users who do not have a specific
    language or region preference. This tag is useful for sites that do not have a single preferred language or region. -->
    <link rel="alternate" hreflang="es" href="" />
    <!-- This tag specifies an alternate version of the page for users who speak Spanish. The hreflang attribute is set to "es",
    indicating that the URL (https://www.setmore.com/es/) is the Spanish-language version of the page. This tag helps search
    engines to correctly index and display the Spanish version of the page for users who speak that language. -->

    <script src="" defer></script>
    <script src="" async></script>
    <!-- defer and async are attributes that can be used with <script> tags in HTML to 
        control how JavaScript files are loaded and executed.
        
        The defer attribute tells the browser to download the script file in the background 
        and defer its execution until the page has finished parsing.This means that the HTML 
        parsing and rendering process will not be blocked by the JavaScript file, and the 
        file will be executed once the DOM is fully loaded. Multiple scripts with defer attributes
        will be executed in the order they appear in the HTML document.    

        The async attribute tells the browser to download the script file in the background and 
        execute it as soon as it is downloaded, without waiting for the HTML parsing to complete.
        This means that the script file will not block the HTML parsing and rendering process, 
        but it may execute before the DOM is fully loaded. Multiple scripts with async attributes 
        may be executed in any order.    
        
        In general, defer is preferred over async for scripts that need to be executed after the DOM is 
        fully loaded, since it ensures that the scripts will be executed in the order they appear in the 
        HTML document.However, async may be more appropriate for scripts that do not depend on the DOM, 
        or for cases where it is important to load the script file as quickly as possible. -->
